EXPERIENCE

BioMarin Pharmaceutical, San Rafael, CA          APR 2015 — MAY 2024 {9yr}
Principal Engineer, Bioinformatics | Genomics
•  Architected bioinformatics databases and applications for analysis of genetic variants in rare diseases. These systems included variant and transcriptomic repositories and viewers, genetic and proteomic profilers, a metabolite viewer, as well as UKBiobank phenotype catalog and analysis results DBs and web UIs. 
•  Managed large and small external and internally sourced datasets, which included sequence, assay, phenotype, EHR, and custom annotation datatypes used to prioritize top lists of disease and gene target candidates. Designed a storage standard for datasets in AWS S3, including a cataloging method in Benchling, defined lifecycle policies, and scripted HPC data migration methods.
•  Lead engineering teams of 15+ remote contractors in the construction of two gene therapy sequencing pipelines using custom HPC SLURM jobs and DNAnexus workflows, integrated with Benchling for upstream run configurations, stored midstream results in Postgres, queried via GraphQL APIs, and explored downstream results in Spotfire dashboards and custom web UIs built in ReactJS. 
•  Built systems to enhance scientific workflows, including:
      An oligo designer web tool in SvelteJS for ASO tiling and chemistry modifications, including a sequence patent application export feature that saved upwards of 3 months and $20,000 of outsourcing time and costs per filing.
      A Python web app for bulk uploading assay results into Benchling, which fed a data warehouse and downstream Spotfire reporting dashboard, turning days of manual data wrangling for lab scientists into a few hours of configuring and fine tuning.
•  Co-produced platforms for best practices in app source code management and automated app deployment: GitLab with CI/CD, RConnect for Shiny, Jupyter and RStudio for data exploration, and Quarto and Markdoc for generating and sharing app docs. Also lead informal presentations and training sessions on the use of those systems.
